## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- Cube CSS

### What I learned

The things that I learn while finishing this challenge are:

1. Use of Grid Column
    - I also learned that I can manipulate the grid even though the grid-template-row dont' have any value.

2. Cube CSS
    - This brilliant talk of Andy Bell's [“Be the browser’s mentor, not its micromanager"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uhIiI9Ld5M) really get met going to learn Cube CSS. I'm not sure if I did it correctly or follow any best practices.

### Continued development

I want to focus more in using Cube CSS, The simplicity, pragmatism and consistency really sway me to using it.

### Useful resources

- [Utopia Fluid Responsove Design](https://utopia.fyi/) - This helped me for calculating fluid font and fluid space.
